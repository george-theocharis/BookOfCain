# API Credentials
In order to access Blizzard's API, you have to generate a client id and a client secret.
After these are generated, add a secret.properties file to the root directory.
In there copy and paste these two keys replacing "XXXXXXX" with your client id and secret.
`CLIENT_ID=XXXXXXX
 CLIENT_SECRET=XXXXXXX`
